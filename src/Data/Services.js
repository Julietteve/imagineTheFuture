            "“Be patient to all that is unsolved in your heart, and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”   ~ Rainer Maria Rilke",
            "My approach to coaching clients is based on trust, partnership, and providing value. They may be stuck, at a crossroads,  looking to reinvent, transform to create a future that aligns with their authentic selves, and what they value most. Through exploration, discovery and clear action plans we design paths that support transformation in alignment to priorities, lifestyle, and where they are. Engagements can be short, long and outcomes will be set by identifying goals that gradually move the client forward. The tools and processes are designed to uncover and discover long-lost hopes and dreams, find true motivation and purpose and see where habits and fears may have become blocks. By eliminating or becoming aware of those blocks, clients are able to understand themselves and take action to create fulfilment in life and work.",
