            "“Be patient to all that is unsolved in your heart, and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”   ~ Rainer Maria Rilke",
            "My approach is based on providing a safe space where my clients can feel free to express themselves without judgment. They may be stuck, at a crossroads,  looking to reinvent, transform to create a future that aligns with their authentic selves, and what they value most. Through exploration, discovery and clear action plans and accountability, they will design a bright future, and manage transformation in alignment to priorities, lifestyle, and where they are. Engagements can be short, long and outcomes will be set by identifying goals that gradually move the client forward. The tools and processes are designed to uncover and discover long-lost hopes and dreams, find true motivation and purpose and see where habits and fears may have become blocks. By eliminating or becoming aware of those blocks, clients are able to understand themselves and take action to create fulfillment in life and work.",

        question : "What is coaching ?",
        answer : "Coaching is a partnership between a client and a coach with one goal in mind: to improve lives. A coach can be a thinking partner, someone who helps clients explore, discover and clarify questions so clients can move forward with confidence. A coach helps clients to create goals, develop a plan and define clear, measurable steps to drive change, decision making, and enhance their life, e.g. change jobs, find a job, advance their career, improve relationships, have better life balance. An integral part of coaching is helping clients be accountable to achieve desired outcomes. Coaching focuses on the present with a view towards the future."

    {
        question : "How do I know if coaching is right for me?",
        answer : "If you feel stuck and uneasy about making changes in life or work, a coach can help you develop action steps to drive you forward. If you are at a crossroads needing to make a change, coaching can be a great way to find clarity, make decisions and support you after the decision is made. If going through a life or career, a coach allows you to explore options and provide a safe space to voice thoughts and feelings. You may feel confused or demotivated, misaligned with your values, hopes and dreams, so a coach can help you realign so you can make changes that fit with your authentic self. You may need a partner for accountability; support with planning and goal setting and building the right habits. If in doubt, a complimentary session will help you decide if coaching is right for you."
    },
    {
        question : "How expensive is it?",
        answer : "If you ask this question, you are closer to deciding whether coaching is for you. Coaching fees can be an hourly fee and most coaches offer different packages that vary in length and depth. Coaching is a journey which depends on the issue or issues a client brings forth. Some people need specific support or guidance for a specific reason e.g. interview preparation, workplace issues; career decisions, etc. therefore, the hourly rate fits well in these cases. The coach will listen and suggest program options that fit the client’s goals, and budget. If you think you would like to work with a coach, explore this option, you will definitely get something from a free consultation. Investing in coaching may not seem the right move. At the same time, if coaching makes you wonder and dream about a brighter future, explore, it may be the best thing you do for yourself."
    },
    {
        question : "Is consulting the same as coaching?",
        answer : "Consulting is about advising, suggesting and giving recommendations and providing information to a client. The consulting tells the client what to do rather than guiding them to find answers. Coaches with a professional area of expertise can provide advice only if the coaching clients express interest - otherwise, consulting is a separate service/engagement."
