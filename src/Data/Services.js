        question : "What is coaching?",
        answer : "Coaching is a partnership between a client and a coach with one goal in mind: to improve lives and help move people forward.  A coach is a thinking partner, someone who helps clients explore, discover and clarify questions so clients can move forward with confidence. A coach helps clients create goals, develop a plan and define clear, measurable action steps to drive change, decision making, and enhance their life, e.g. change jobs, find a job, advance their career, improve relationships, have better life balance. An integral part of coaching is helping clients be accountable to achieve desired outcomes. Coaching focuses on the present with a view towards the future."
    },
    {
        question : "How do I know if coaching is right for me?",
        answer : "If you feel stuck and uneasy about making changes in life or work, a coach can help you prioritize, plan and create action steps to drive you forward. If you are at a crossroads needing to make a change, coaching can be a great way to find clarity, make decisions and support you after the decision is made. If going through a life or career, a coach allows you to explore options and provide a safe space to voice thoughts and feelings. You may feel confused or demotivated, misaligned with your values, hopes and dreams, so a coach can help you realign so you can make changes that fit with your authentic self. You may need a partner for accountability; support with planning and goal setting and building the right habits. If in doubt, a complimentary session will help you decide if coaching is right for you."
    },
    {
        question : "How expensive is it?",
        answer : "If you ask this question, you are closer to deciding whether coaching is for you. Coaching fees vary from an hourly fee to packages that vary in length and depth. Coaching is a journey which depends on the issue or issues a client brings forth. Some people need specific support or guidance for a specific reason e.g. interview preparation, workplace issues; career decisions, etc. therefore, the hourly rate fits well in these cases. The coach will listen and suggest program options that fit the client’s goals, and budget. If you think you would like to work with a coach, explore this option, you will definitely get something from a free consultation. Investing in coaching may not seem the right move. At the same time, if coaching makes you wonder and dream about a brighter future, explore, it may be the best thing you do for yourself."
    },
    {
        question : "What is the difference between consulting and coaching?",
        answer : "Consulting is about advising, suggesting and giving recommendations and providing information to a client. The consulting tells the client what to do rather than guiding them to find answers. Coaches with a professional area of expertise can provide advice only if the coaching clients express interest - otherwise, consulting is a separate service/engagement."
